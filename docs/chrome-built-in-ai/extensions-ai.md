# Extensions and AI | Chrome for Developers

### Extensions and AI

AI can mean many things: machine learning, large language models, generative AI,
and more. Find resources built to help you understand how to effectively use AI
in Chrome Extensions.

### Build AI-powered Chrome Extensions with Gemini

Learn how to use client-side, on-device, and cloud-hosted AI to optimize the web

You can build AI-powered extensions that summarize text, help with translation,
generate content, assist with coding, provide recommendations, personalize user
interfaces, and so much more. Check out how the Google Creative Lab team used AI
and extensions to build an interactive creative coding experience.
