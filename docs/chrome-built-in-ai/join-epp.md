We need your input to shape the APIs, determine if they fulfill your use cases, and inform our discussions with other browser vendors for standardization.

Join the early preview program (EPP) to provide feedback on early-stage built-in AI ideas, and gain opportunities to test in-progress, unreleased APIs through local prototyping.
