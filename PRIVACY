# üõ°Ô∏è Tabby Privacy Statement

Your privacy is top priority. Tabby is designed with a **local-first** approach
to ensure your browsing data stays on your device.

## What Tabby Does

- Tabby organizes and manages your browser tabs locally.
- No browsing data, tab information, or personal details are ever sold, tracked,
  or shared.
- I do not use analytics, tracking scripts, or any third-party monitoring tools.

## AI Usage

- By default, **all features run locally** on your device.
- If you choose to **opt-in to cloud-based AI (Gemini API)**, only the minimal
  relevant content from active tabs will be sent securely to the AI model to
  generate suggestions.
- Cloud AI interactions are subject to Google‚Äôs Gemini Privacy Policy, and Tabby
  fully adheres to their terms.
- I do not control or store any data processed by Google‚Äôs systems, and the data
  is not used for model training to my knowledge as part of their paid plan.
- You can disable cloud AI features anytime in the settings.

## My Commitment

I will **never sell, track, or exploit your data** for any purpose. Tabby exists
to make your workflow simpler, not to compromise your privacy.
